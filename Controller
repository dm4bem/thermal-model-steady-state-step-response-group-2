    "Currently, we aim to assess the influence of considering the controller on the time step, due to how it affects the dynamics of the studied system.\n",
    "We assume that taking the controller into account would result in a smaller time step to allow for more frequent and finer adjustments.\n",
    "Following the modification of the code (lines at the bottom of the page), we observe that when the controller is disabled, meaning the model operates in "free-running" mode and thus evolves without external intervention to adjust its parameters, the time step is dt = 5 min. Indeed, in this mode, the time step is relatively large because the system does not need to be adjusted frequently. Changes in system conditions can be assumed to be relatively slow and therefore require a larger time step to model them.
In contrast, when the controller is enabled, meaning the model can adjust its parameters based on the current system conditions, the time step is dt = 50 s. This reduction in the time step allows the controller to make faster and more precise decisions.\n",

controller = True --> the controller is activated
controller = False --> the controller is in free-running
