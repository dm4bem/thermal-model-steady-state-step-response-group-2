Indeed, a too small time step can result in performance issues or even script termination, as we hace noticed. To use a higher Kp while avoiding issues with too small time steps, it may be necessary to adjust other parameters of the controller or the thermal model to ensure stability and performance of the system. For instance, adding to this modification, neglecting the air glass capacity allows for an increase in this time step (which becomes 2 h).
