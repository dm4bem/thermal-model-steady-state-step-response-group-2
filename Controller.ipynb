Indeed, in this mode, the time step is relatively large because the system does not need to be adjusted frequently. Changes in system conditions can be assumed to be relatively slow and therefore require a larger time step to model them.\nIn contrast, when the controller is enabled, meaning the model can adjust its parameters based on the current system conditions, the time step is dt = 50 s. This reduction in the time step allows the controller to make faster and more precise decisions.","metadata":{},"id":"790a2e17-a9c0-4520-ad8a-7e4ca850b193"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"controller = True # the controller is activated\ncontroller = False # the controller is in free-running","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"73550a41-536d-4e2d-a904-682158c106c9"}]}
